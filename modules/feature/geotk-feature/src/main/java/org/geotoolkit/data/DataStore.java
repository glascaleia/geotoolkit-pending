/**
 * Access to Feature content from a service or file.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Description</h2>
 * The DataAccess interface provides the following information about its contents:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link DataAccess.getInfo()} - information about the file or server itself
 * <li>{@link DataAccess.getNames()} - list of the available contents (each is an individual resource)
 * <li>{@link DataAccess.getSchema( Name )} - FeatureType describing the information available in the named resource
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h2>Contents</h2>
 * You can access the contents of a service or file using getFeatureSource( Name ). Depending the
 * abilities of your implementation and your credentials you will have access to
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link FeatureSource}: read-only api similar to the WFS getFeature operations. Please note the reutrned
 *    FeatureCollection may be *lazy*; for many implementations no actual access will occur until you
 *    use the FetaureCollection for the first time.
 * <li>{@link FeatureStore}: read/write api similar to the WFS Transaction operation. Batch changes such as
 *    addFeatures, modifyFeatures and removeFeatures are supported.
 * <li>{@link FeatureLocking}: concurrency control; the Data Access API is thread safe; one consequence of this
 * is modifications being held up while other threads read the contents. You may wish to Lock a selection
 * of features for your exclusive use. Locks are timed; and will expire after the indicated period.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Please note that all interaction occurs within the context of a Transaction, this
 * facility provides session management and is strongly advised. Please note that
 * your application is responsible for managing its own Transactions; as an example
 * they are often associated with a single Map in a desktop application; or a single
 * session in a J2EE web app.
 * <p>
 * The use of Transaction.AUTO_COMMIT is suitable for read-only access when you wish
 * to minimize the number of connections in use, when used for writing performance
 * will often be terrible.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * Normal use:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Connect using a DataAccessFactory.createDataStore using a set of connection parameters
 * <li>Application is responsible for holding a single instance to the service or file, DataAccess
 * implementations will hold onto database connections, internal caches and so on - and as such
 * should not be duplicated.
 * <li>DataAccess.dispose() is called when the application is shut down
 * </ul>
 *
 * Creation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Created using a DataStoreFactory.createNewDataStore using a set of creation parameters
 * <li>DataAccess.createSchema( T ) is called to set up the contents
 * <li>DataAccess.getFetaureSource( Name ) is called, and FeatureStore.addFeatures( collection ) used to populate the contents
 * <li>DataAccess.dispose() is called when the application is shut down
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Applications are responsible for holding a single instance to the service or file, The
 * DataAccess implementations will hold onto database connections, internal caches and so on - and as such
 * should not be duplicated.
 *
 * <p>
 * Summary of our requirements:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Provides lookup of available Feature Types
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Provides access to low-level Readers/Writers API for a feature type
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Provides access to high-level FeatureSource/Store/Locking API a feature type
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Handles the conversion of filters into data source specific queries
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Handles creation of new Feature Types
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Provides access of Feature Type Schema information
 * </li>
 * </ul>
