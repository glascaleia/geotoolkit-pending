/**
 * Coordinate associated with an intersection between two lines. This class is reseved for internal
 * use in order to determine how we should reclose geometric shapes of islands and continents.
 * The point memorised by this class will come from the intersection of two lines:
 * one of the edges of the map (generally one of the 4 sides of a rectangle, but it could be another
 * geometric shape) with a line passing through the two first or the two last points of the 
 * shore line.  We will call the first line (that of the map edge) "<code>line</code>".
 * This class will memorise the scalar product between a vector passing through the first point
 * of <code>line</code> and the intersection point with a vector passing through the first and last
 * points of <code>line</code>. This scalar product can be viewed as a sort of measure of the distance
 * between the start of <code>line</code> and the intersection point.
