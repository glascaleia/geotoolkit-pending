/**
 * Factory used to construct a CoverageStore from a set of parameters.
 * 
 * <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
 * <p>
 * An instance of this interface should exist for all data stores which want to
 * take advantage of the dynamic plug-in system. In addition to implementing
 * this factory interface each CoverageStore implementation should have a services file:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>META-INF/services/org.geotoolkit.coverage.CoverageStoreFactory</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The file should contain a single line which gives the full name of the
 * implementing class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * example:<br/><code>e.g.
 * org.geotoolkit.data.mytype.MyTypeDataSourceFacotry</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The factories are never called directly by client code, instead the
 * CoverageStoreFinder class is used.
 * </p>

     * <p>
     * One may ask how this is different than canProcess, and basically available
     * is used by the CoverageStoreFinder getAvailableCoverageStore method, so that
     * CoverageStores that can not even be used do not show up as options in gui
     * applications.
