    Overview of <A HREF="http://pending.geotoolkit.org">Geotoolkit-Pending.org</A>.

    <H2>Pending is the incubator</H2>
    <P ALIGN="justify">
    Geotk-pending is an incubator, modules may enter or exit without any obligations
    (like using geotoolkit-logging or backward compatibility). The objective of this project
    is to host new module that should end in the official Geotk modules. Each module has different
    quality level of code, testing and documentation.
    Some modules have reached a good stability for several months now like :<br/>
    - geotk-style<br/>
    - geotk-go2-engine<br/>
    - geotk-filter<br/>
    - geotk-wms<br/>
    <br/>
    The incubator offer plenty of interesting new features that you can use, just keep in mind
    that the classes you use may be changed, renamed, moved or in the worse case removed at any time.

    <H2>Requirements</H2>
    <P ALIGN="justify">Geotk-pending requires Java 6 Standard Edition and Geotk main modules.
    The recomandations about <A HREF="https://jai.dev.java.net/">Java Advanced Imaging</A> extension
    for coverage and <A HREF="http://developers.sun.com/javadb/">JavaDB</A> for the EPSG database
    are also valid for Geotk-pending. <A HREF="http://javadoc.geotoolkit.org">More d√©tails on Geotk documentation</A>
